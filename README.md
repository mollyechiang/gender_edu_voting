# Education Reforms and Voting Conservative

### A Replication and Extension of "Education and Voting Conservative: Evidence from a Major Schooling Reform in Great Britain" (Marshall 2015)

This is an extension of Marshall (2015), which shows the causal effect of additional years of schooling on voting conservative via regression discontinuty analysis on voting records of individuals before and after the British 1947 school-leaving age reform. This extension aims to see if the same effect is found in an analysis of a later education reform in England.
